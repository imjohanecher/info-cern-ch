    </head>
    <body> Hypertext is text which contains links to other text. The term was coined by Ted Nelson around 1965 (see History)

        HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and sound , for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.

Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.
